Client Side Search is something we all want to support. Then again, if all the content is static on the page shown, how would you do the search? Turns out there is a nice little library called Lunr.js which abstracts the pain of having to store a dictionary of words and it's great at not just generating results but also ranking them in order of relevance. 

In this code, I am showing a snippet from the project I am currently working on. The project is a ECMASCript Specification Viewer which supports search, and facilitates discussion.
